Book Buddy - Final Project Proposal 

1. Overview 

Book Buddy is a personal reading companion web application that helps book lovers discover, organize, and engage with their reading journey. The problem it solves is the scattered nature of book discovery, reading tracking, and meaningful engagement with book content. Many readers struggle to keep track of books they want to read, remember key insights from books they've finished, and find new books that match their interests. My motivation comes from being an avid reader who has experienced these challenges firsthand and seeing how technology can enhance the reading experience without replacing the joy of actual reading. 

2. Target Audience 

Primary: Casual to avid readers aged 18-45 who enjoy discovering new books and want to better organize their reading life 

Secondary: Students and professionals who read for learning and want to retain and revisit key information 

Tertiary: Book club members who want to engage more deeply with their reading material 

3. Major Functions 

Book Search and Discovery: Users can search for books using the Google Books API, view detailed information including covers, descriptions, ratings, and author details. 

Personal Book Library: Users can maintain separate lists for "Currently Reading," "Want to Read," and "Finished" books with cover images and metadata. 

Text Book Upload and Reading: Users can upload text files (.txt) of books they own and read them within the application with a clean, distraction-free interface. 

Reading Progress Tracking: The application tracks reading progress for uploaded books, showing percentage completed and estimated time remaining. 

AI-Powered Q&A: Users can ask questions about books they've uploaded using OpenAI API integration, helping them understand themes, characters, and plot points. 

Highlight and Notes System: Readers can highlight text passages and add personal notes while reading uploaded books, with all annotations saved locally. 

Reading Statistics Dashboard: Users can view their reading statistics including books completed this month/year, pages read, and reading streaks. 

Book Recommendations: Based on reading history and preferences, the application suggests new books using the Google Books API and user rating patterns. 

4. Wireframes 

[Note: In a real proposal, you would include actual wireframe images here] 

Desktop Wireframes: 

Main Dashboard: Grid layout with book covers, statistics widgets, and navigation sidebar 

Library View: Three-column layout for different reading lists with drag-and-drop functionality 

Reading Interface: Clean, centered text column with sidebar for notes and highlights 

Search Page: Search bar at top with grid results below showing book covers and details 

Mobile Wireframes: 

Stack-based navigation with hamburger menu 

Swipeable book lists

10. Challenges 

Biggest Anticipated Challenges: 

API Rate Limiting: Managing Google Books API and OpenAI API rate limits while providing smooth user experience, especially during book searches and AI interactions. 

Text Processing for AI: Efficiently chunking and processing large text files for meaningful AI analysis without overwhelming the API or user's browser performance. 

Mobile Reading Experience: Creating a comfortable, responsive reading interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices with proper typography and spacing. 

Data Persistence: Ensuring reliable localStorage management for potentially large amounts of text content and user data without hitting browser storage limits. 

Performance Optimization: Keeping the application responsive when handling large text files and multiple API calls simultaneously, especially on slower devices.

üö® Risk Mitigation for Each Component 

High-Risk Components (Build these first): 

Storage Manager - Everything depends on this 

File Upload Handler - Core functionality 

Reading Interface - Primary user experience 

Medium-Risk Components (Have backup plans): 

API Services - Can be simplified if needed 

AI Integration - Can be removed if problematic 

Advanced UI - Can be simplified 

Low-Risk Components (Can be cut if needed): 

Advanced statistics - Nice to have 

Complex animations - Polish only 

Advanced AI features - Enhancement only 

 

üìã Daily Success Criteria 

Each day, you should be able to answer "YES" to: 

Can I demonstrate what I built today? 

Does it work reliably with the components from previous days? 

If I stopped here, would users still get value? 

Can I deploy what I have so far? 

This breakdown ensures each component is valuable on its own while building toward the complete vision.
